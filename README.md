# Headboard for 16mm scale model railway trains
OpenSCAD script for generating headboards for 16mm scale model railway trains

# Summary

Create curved style headboards in 16mm scale for your model trains, with two rows of text which you can customise.

Parameters you can set include: upper row text, lower row text, thickness of the backboard and the lettering, the font height, and how curved the lettering will be (by setting the radius of the upper edge of the headboard).

# Print Settings

Initially I printed these in ABS to use on live steam models because, mounting them on the lamp bracket above the smokebox, I was worried about the heat. Since then I have tried with PLA and that seems fine too.

# Post-Printing

I have found the best approach to painting to be to completely paint in the lettering colour, wait for it to dry, and then paint the background before finally polishing any excess paint of the letters and the surround.

# How I Designed This

I described how I designed this on a thread on the [Garden Rails forum](https://gardenrails.org/viewtopic.php?p=166648#p166648)
